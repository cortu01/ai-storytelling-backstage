    "To make things a little easier, we'll be restricting our view of the inputs to just a 5 by 5 square, where each cell in that square is either black or white—a binary encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our inputs will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "⬛️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬛️ | ⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️ | ⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️\n",

    "Now, this is all very well and good for our Human Eyeballs™—we're hardwired to recognize blocks of color. Computers and math, however, don't do as well with blocks of color, so we'll have to pick a way to represent our cells numerically. A simple choice is to map ON to a one, and OFF to a zero.\n",

    "Here's what an example X will look like as a matrix of ones and zeros:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that in Python, matrices are represented as an array of arrays. We're also creating a [NumPy](https://numpy.org) array, meaning we'll be using NumPy to do our calculations down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, whitespace is optional within the context of writing arrays in Python, we could have just as easily written:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "example_X = np.array([[1,0,0,0,1],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,1]])\n",
