Submission will be done on the course's Learn page, where you will also find the submission and feedback dates. You need to submit a downloaded copy of this notebook filled in, as well as a copy of any image files you brought from outside the notebook (this is relevant for Exercise A). If you have improvised in some way (where the coursework allows it) and used further external media, these should also be uploaded with the submission.\n",

Assuming you have added some AI tools from the course, and with a GPU active, running a notebook (Runtime -> Run all) for the first time will take about 5 minutes (though you might have to be available for responding to some prompts). If you forget to change to GPU, or Google happens to not have any available at the moment, and you run on a CPU, than the same process would take about 40 minutes.\n",

This just has to do with how the randomisation is happening. Avoid losing work you like by making sure you download copies of the notebook as backups (Download-> Download .ipnyb), and be careful when rerunning cells where you are happy with the output, as you might lose the previous output if you have not saved a copy.\n",

This is the tool OpenAI ostensibly uses to check whether the texts its models generate need to be censored before forwarding to a user. \n",

        "First, run the cells bewlow in order and observe the output of the cells titled \"*Accessing the moderation results programmatically*\". What we have done is extracted a text (not a boolean value) of \"True\" or \"False\" for the criterion of \"hate\". Now fill in the if-statement in the next cell so that it similarly checks the value for the criterion of \"violence\".\n",

To avoid trivial solutions, please keep the minimum length at 4 words.\n",
