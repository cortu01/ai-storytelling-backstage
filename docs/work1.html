                    The Story
                </h2>


                <p>
                    Once a famous vampire racer, Jean-Marc was left
                    heartbroken after his daughter Lola was murdered by
                    a mysterious group of spies <!--1-->. Lola, a skilled
                    hacker, was a member of the Bat faction in the
                    midst of a bitter war with the Bunny faction <!--2-->.
                    As the conflict between the two factions escalated,
                    a spy network of animal code names became more
                    active in gathering intelligence and carrying out
                    covert operations<!--3-->. Even after her death, Lola
                    joined the Bat team as a ghost hacker to help track
                    down her killers. <!--4-->
                </p>

                </div>


                <p>
                    During the escalating conflict, two members of the Cat
                    faction were murdered, and the Bat team suspected the
                    Bunnies were responsible. In the chaos that ensued, Lola
                    was wrongly accused of the murders and was forced to go on
                    the run as a ghost to evade capture while investigating her
                    own death.
                </p>


                <p>
                    As tensions rose, the spy network decided to host an annual
                    baseball game <!--5-->, which served as a cover for a covert
                    mission to uncover the truth behind the Cat faction
                    murders. Unexpectedly, the Bunnies started to shift back
                    into human form while playing the game, something they
                    hadn't been able to do in years due to their lack of
                    emotional connection to humanity.<!--6-->
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Meanwhile, Jean-Marc <!--7,8-->, driven by his grief, sought
                    revenge on Lola's killers and discovered that his
                    arch-nemesis, Lola's stepfather Lord Roshan Roshan <!--9-->,
                    was the head of the spy group responsible. But the vampire
                    soon learned that the spy group was not the true enemy, as
                    they were hired by a rabbit who wanted to rule the world by
                    taking Lola's crown<!--10,11-->.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, Lola's pet rabbit turned out to be the
                    reason for her death <!--12-->. After becoming a wandering
                    ghost, she joined a time-traveling society to become an
                    assassin and revenge on Jean-Marc, but in the end,
                    accidentally killed him and his friend at a bar with
                    poisoned drinks, leading to her transformation back into a
                    human <!--13,16-17-->.
                </p>

                    Back to the present, a meteor fell near a rabbit village
                    <!--18-->, and a group of spies suddenly appeared, forcing the
                    rabbits to flee to a nearby mansion. Inside, they found a
                    strange box, and a ghost-like female named Laura appeared
                    <!--19-->, who asked for their help to stop the spies and
                    offered the clue to an ancient and powerful crown. With
                    Laura's guidance, the rabbits found the crown <!--14,15--> but
                    accidentally broke the seal, releasing a vampire trapped
                    inside <!--19-->.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the end, the Bat and Bunny factions put aside their
                    differences to stop the rogue Rat faction, who were
                    planning a massive attack on both groups. With Lola's help
                    and the cooperation of the spy network, the factions were
                    able to infiltrate the Rat stronghold and prevent the
                    attack. In the aftermath, the factions vowed to promote
                    peace and understanding between their groups, and the spy
                    network expanded their reach to other planets, spreading
                    their rule to all corners of the universe <!--20,21-->.
